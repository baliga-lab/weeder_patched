I was able to cross-compile on AROS with

./configure --host=i386-aros CC=$AROS_SDK_HOME/bin/x86_64-aros-gcc
i386-aros
x86_64-aros

and to 68k Amiga with


./configure --host=m68k-amigaos CC=vc CFLAGS=+aos68k
m68k-cbm-amigaos
m68k-amigaos

TODO:

Recognize host and add settings about endianess etc.

==== How it was created ====

1. First steps

I've created a simple hello.c and then some
supplementary files

- AUTHORS
- ChangeLog
- NEWS
- README

that autoconf expects to exist.

Then I made

- Makefile.am

and ran

autoscan

to generate a preliminary configure.scan file.

2. Next steps

mv configure.scan configure.ac

3. Edit configure.ac
